         It has been great having Jessica watch our cats!  She is very friendly and dependable.  
         When she comes by to take care of the cats (we have 3), she takes time to play with them and gives each of them attention.  
         She has always responded quickly when I’ve asked her to check in and has proactively contacted me if she’s had any questions/concerns. 
         When I come back my cats are always doing very well.  
         I’d highly recommend her as a pet-sitter. — Jeffrey Foy (owner of Mr. Sassy, Pigeon, and Henry)

         Jessica has helped out immensely whenever I have to go out of town on business.  
         Not only does she attend to the feeding and  general maintenance of Opus (the cat who lets me live here), but she has a genuine rapport with my furry friend.  
         She takes the time to keep him company and not just dash in and out. Given her background and education, I feel safe in knowing that if there were ever a sudden medical 
         or health issue, Jessica would know how to handle it. — Jon Truelson (owned by Opus the Cat)

         Jessica has been a huge help when we've been out of town. We determined it was more cost effective to have Jessica house-sit and watch the animals for us when we had 2 dogs and 2 cats to care for. 
         We are now down to only 1 dog and the 2 cats, but one of the cats now requires 2x daily medication which Jessica is very comfortable administering. She provides our dog (a lab/greyhound mix) 
         with plenty of walks and treats...even managing his urgent need to rid the park of all deer, squirrels and mourning doves! 
         In addition to her excellent care of our fur-babies, she takes great care of the house, picking up our mail and gives us the peace of mind that our house doesn't look empty, while we're out of town. 
         Additionally, the last time we left town, our kitchen faucet had broken right before we left...the earliest the plumbers were able to get there was the day after we left. 
         She was able to meet the plumbers and manage their presence in our home, taking a huge burden off of us! We highly recommend her; both as a pet sitter and as a house sitter!
